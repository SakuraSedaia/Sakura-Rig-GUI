# Sakura's Rig GUI

The Rig GUI is a new project by Sakura Sedaia with the goal of enabling easier customization and configuration among my many rigs, while Version 1 only had support for SACR R7.2.1 Version 2 adds the ability to include other rigs into the addon just by adding in their modules into the main handler script.
